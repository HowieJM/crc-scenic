# Jupyter notebook tunnel (cheatsheet)

**Purpose:** View a loom quickly from a remote VM in your local browser, and optionally peek inside with Python.

---

## 1) Set up on the VM

```bash
# (optional) for compatibility with some loom tooling
python3 -m pip install --user 'numpy<2.0'

# start Jupyter without opening a browser on the VM
python3 -m pip install --user notebook
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888

# copy the token URL printed by Jupyter
# (you can also list it later via: jupyter notebook list)
```

## 2) 
```bash
```

## 3) 
```bash
```
